Spring Boot App

The Spring Boot app is built using Java, with the Spring Boot framework providing a convenient way to create the app quickly and easily. Here are some of the key features and technologies used:

Spring Security: This is a powerful security framework that allows the app to implement secure authentication and authorization for users. Spring Security can be used to secure the endpoints of the application, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain parts of the app.

Spring Data JPA: This is a powerful data access framework that makes it easy to work with databases in Spring Boot apps. Spring Data JPA can be used to connect to a database, define data models, and interact with data using standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Thymeleaf: This is a popular templating engine for building web applications in Spring Boot. Thymeleaf provides a convenient way to build dynamic, data-driven web pages that can be easily customized using HTML and CSS.

Spring Boot Mail: This is a library that provides easy integration with email functionality. This library can be used to send emails to users upon successful order completion, providing them with an email confirmation.

Overall, the Spring Boot app would provide a convenient and secure way for customers to purchase books online, while also providing an efficient system for bookstore administrators to manage inventory and orders. The use of Java, Spring Boot, and related technologies would allow for efficient development and deployment of the application, while providing robust security and scalability features.
